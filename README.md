# symmetry reversion for RMSD calculation

After a molecular dynamics simulation of a protein crystal unit cell I want to be able to revert the symmetry operations to be able to compute the root mean square deviation between the different copies in the unit cell.

Originally I wrote the script in R, but I have started to translate it to Python. I want to find out if this is faster (I think so) and I want to get familiar with the pandas library in Python.
